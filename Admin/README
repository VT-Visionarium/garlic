This is an attempt keep notes about general computer system
administration for the Virginia Tech Visionarium.  I need to keep these
notes somewhere that can be easily accessed by others.  Since there are
no secrets in this information can be put on github.com.

I was using google drive, but it's interfaces suck to much time.
I can run git pull and git push faster than loading a web page and
the N other pages needed to navigate to folders in google drive.
