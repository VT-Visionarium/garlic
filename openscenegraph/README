# We got open scene graph (osg) from github.  In this
# directory we ran:

  git clone https://github.com/openscenegraph/osg.git git

# We built/installed from the directories in here other than git/
# The directory corresponds with the installed osg version.
# At the time of this writing just OpenSceneGraph-3.5.1/
# which we 'git archive TAG' to get from this local git repo.

# Open Scene Graph has many dependences, see file 'dependences'.

# cd to OpenSceneGraph-3.5.1/ and look at ./install.bash
