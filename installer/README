This directory is to help automate the installing of many software
packages on the system proper visa apt-get (or yum) in addition
to picking the packages that are install on a named system, like
on the system with hostname (hostname -s) viz3.


CAUTION: in order to get dependences install we had to run sudo apt-get
in scripts in this directory.

You may want to run 'apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade'
before run any of this stuff.


FILES:

   apt-get_common.bash

       installs lots of deb packages via apt-get,
       and removes the ubuntu update-manager which is
       a pain in the ass.


   install.bash

        runs the stuff in file `hostname -s`.  For example
        viz3 in this directory.


   files with names that are hosts

        For example viz3
