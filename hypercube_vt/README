We call this project HyperCube VT for hyper cube at Virginia Tech.  It
contains programs that are specific to the Virginia Tech Hyper Cube or
VisCube or CAVE, whatever you call it.

See general cube OS installation notes in ../Admin/README_cube.

All CAVE's are different.  They have different projection systems,
tracking systems, computer systems, and the Virginia Tech CAVE has a 6
degree-of-freedom motion platform.  They also run different mixtures of
computer operating systems. Very few CAVEs are the same.

All the programs that are installed from this project have the prefix hy_


This project is only good for the VT CAVE, so it need not follow the
garlic standard install methods.


To install on the VT hyperCube:

   edit hy_startx and select you default resolution by
   picking a value for XORGCONFIG

   then (CAUTION: 'make install' will run 'sudo'):

      make
      make install
