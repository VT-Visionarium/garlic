We call this project HyperCube VT for hyper cube at Virginia Tech.  It
contains programs that are specific to the Virginia Tech Hyper Cube or
VisCube or CAVE, whatever you call it.

All CAVE's are different.  They have different projection systems,
tracking systems, computer systems, and the Virginia Tech CAVE has a 6
degree-of-freedom motion platform.  They also run different mixtures of
computer operating systems. Very few CAVEs are the same.

All the programs that are installed from this project have the prefix hy_


This project is only good for the VT CAVE, so it need not follow the
garlic standard install methods.

To install run:

    make install


Notes on starting X session from an ssh session on cube, because it has no
monitor.

service lightdm stop
mv /etc/init/lightdm.conf /etc/init/lightdm.conf.disabled

#edit /etc/X11/Xwrapper.config
from:
allowed_users=console
to:
allowed_users=anybody

Then a user can just run 'startx' and stop it to have a X session.

# disable screen blanking through X11
xset s off

killall xfce4-panel
killall light-locker
apt-get purge light-locker
apt-get purge xfce4-panel
apt-get autoremove
