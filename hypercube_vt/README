We call this project HyperCube VT for hyper cube at Virginia Tech.  It
contains programs that are specific to the Virginia Tech Hyper Cube or
VisCube or CAVE, whatever you call it.

All CAVE's are different.  They have different projection systems,
tracking systems, computer systems, and the Virginia Tech CAVE has a 6
degree-of-freedom motion platform.  They also run different mixtures of
computer operating systems. Very few CAVEs are the same.

All the programs that are installed from this project have the prefix hy_


This project is only good for the VT CAVE, so it need not follow the
garlic standard install methods.


To install on the VT hyperCube:

   edit hy_startx and select you default resolution by
   picking a value for XORGCONFIG

   then (CAUTION: 'make install' will run 'sudo'):

      make install



Notes on starting X session from an ssh session on cube, because it has no
monitor.

service lightdm stop
mv /etc/init/lightdm.conf /etc/init/lightdm.conf.disabled

doing a 'apt-get purge lightdm' is not what we want, that will
cause another service to be installed to replace lightdm, yes
ubuntu sucks.


#edit /etc/X11/Xwrapper.config
from:
allowed_users=console
to:
allowed_users=anybody


apt-get purge light-locker xfce4-panel xfce4-power-manager

apt-get autoremove

Then a user can just run 'startx' to have a X session.

startx

Just stop startx with Crl-C or signal it to stop it.
This method of stopping the X session works but only
if a signal can propagate to the x-session-manager
which seems to be thing thing that starts a proper X
session shutdown, or X session logout.
So we wrote to wrapper scripts hy_startx and hy_stopx
that "do the right things" for starting and ending a
user X session, as it is done via the windowing GUIs
but without the GUIs.


# disable screen blanking through X11 one time by:
xset s off
# but it does not work because other things are happening.


The next two things seem to do the trick:

edit /etc/kbd/config
change 3 lines to:
BLANK_DPMS=off
POWERDOWN_TIME=0
BLANK_TIME=0



edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
added lines to Section "ServerLayout"

Option          "BlankTime"     "0"
Option          "StandbyTime"   "0"
Option          "SuspendTime"   "0"
Option          "OffTime"       "0"
