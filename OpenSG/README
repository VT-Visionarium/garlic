This seems to be a dead end.  The current git repo version
git://git.code.sf.net/p/opensg/code git will not build on ubuntu 14.04 
The InstantReality code looks to be using version 1.8 which was
last released on 2007-07-04, so I'm not going to try to build that.


We need to build and install collada-dom before this.
We found no apt-get package for collada-dom so see collada-dom/
where we install it from source.

OpenSG also depends on some of the BOOST C++ libraries so we did a:
apt-get install libboost-all-dev libboost-doc
but found that it was not compatible in compiling OpenSG, giving a
compiler error with a BOOST template.

# This seems to be the code we want, but there are no git tags.
git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/opensg/code git


# this from opensg.org (homepage) seems to be a dead fork of OpenSG
git clone https://github.com/vossg/OpenSGDevMaster.git git


Dependencies:

   collada-dom -- see collada-dom/

   Looks like the debian package available from ubuntu 14.04 is
   not compatible with the current (2016-05-13) OpenSG.  So we'll
   try building Boost from source in boost/.
