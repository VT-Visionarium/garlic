This is to install and configure the computers in our lab as LDAP
clients, that use the local LDAP server for logging in.


Last test of these scripts was Thu May 25 16:47:50 EDT 2017 on
$ lsb_release -a
No LSB modules are available.
Distributor ID:	Ubuntu
Description:	Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS
Release:	16.04

READ root_install?.bash before you just run them.
Run them in the order (0 1 2)
root_install_0.bash root_install_1.bash root_install_2.bash

It can't be just one script because you may need to reboot or run tests at
some points in the process.  The root_install_?.bash scripts are
interactive.


NOTE: We tried the pam-auth-update bullshit but that failed. If you would
like pain then try it.  We got things to work by editing /etc files by hand
via the root_install_?.bash scripts. It's a fucking mess ... You would need
to make your own GNU/Linux distro to clean it up.  That's because the UNIX
/etc/ system is a fucking mess, all interdependent configuration files with
no proof of consistency, except by just running the system; i.e. it runs,
therefore it is consistent.


On Xbuntu 10.04
Look at them and then run: sudo ./root_install_0.bash  and then sudo
./root_install_1.bash and so on.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
# notes for added local groups to users be they ldap or local users
# had to do this after other pam/ldap stuff was done

#add 2 lines to /etc/pam.d/common-auth
# added by lance
auth    required    pam_group.so use_first_pass


cp group.conf /etc/security/group.conf 
service nscd restart

Here's some messy notes, from when we first got LDAP client auth working:



############## Wed Feb 24 18:32:24 EST 2016  ON viz2.sv.vt.edu #######

apt-get install nslcd
# will install: ldap-utils libnss-ldapd libpam-ldapd nscd
# 
# Which seems to leave out the stupid-heads:
# auth-client-config ldap-auth-client ldap-auth-config

>cursers interface pops up:  Configuring nslcd
>LDAP server URI:
ldap://authn.directory.vt.edu


Name services to configure:
  [ ] aliases
  [ ] ethers  
  [*] group  
  [ ] hosts     
  [*] netgroup   
  [ ] networks   
  [*] passwd     
  [ ] protocols  
  [ ] rpc        
  [ ] services   
  [*] shadow    


# then we copied all of /etc/ to /root/ORG_0/ as a backup


# We then edited /etc/ldap/ldap.conf to be

base ou=People,dc=vt,dc=edu
uri ldap://authn.directory.vt.edu
ldap_version 3
pam_login_attribute uupid
ssl start_tls
tls_checkpeer yes
#tls_cacertfile /etc/ca-certificates/vt-cachain.pem
#tls_cacertdir /etc/ca-certificates/
tls_reqcert never
#pam_password exop


# then we should be able to test it with:

ldapsearch -H ldap://authn.directory.vt.edu -x -Z -b ou=People,dc=vt,dc=edu '(uupid=fabidi89)'

# and it spewed a good bit of stuff, 34 lines

strace ldapsearch -H ldap://authn.directory.vt.edu -x -Z\
 -b ou=People,dc=vt,dc=edu '(uupid=fabidi89)'\
 2>&1 >/dev/null | grep ldap.conf 

# gives: open("/etc/ldap/ldap.conf", O_RDONLY)   = 3
# so it in opening /etc/ldap/ldap.conf
# adding to the grep :  grep -n10 ldap.conf
# I see it reads it too.

#then edit /etc/nsswitch.conf



# needed no edits with this:

passwd:         compat ldap
group:          compat ldap
shadow:         compat ldap

hosts:          files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns
networks:       files

protocols:      db files
services:       db files
ethers:         db files
rpc:            db files

netgroup:       nis ldap



# then edit   /etc/pam.d/common-session

#added line
session required         pam_mkhomedir.so  skel=/etc/skel  umask=0022


# then change file /etc/nslcd.conf 
# to be:
uid nslcd
gid nslcd

uri ldap://authn.directory.vt.edu
base dc=vt,dc=edu
ssl start_tls
tls_cacertdir /etc/ca-certificates
tls_cacertfile /etc/ca-certificates/vt-cachain.pem
filter passwd (objectclass=virginiaTechPerson)
map passwd uidNumber uid
map passwd uid uupid
map passwd gidNumber "100"
map passwd homeDirectory "${homeDirectory:-/home/$uupid}"
map passwd loginShell "${loginShell:-/bin/bash}"

# then run with user that is not on the system, but is in ldap
# it should fail
id lanceman

#next:
cp vt-cachain.pem /etc/ca-certificates/


#then run these two commands
service nslcd restart
service nscd restart

# then run
id lanceman

# We note this time is takes much longer to fail

# playing around with starting and stopping nscd and nslcd
# removing /home/lanceman and ssh lanceman@viz3
# It makes sense now.


We need make ssh fail if /home/user is does not exist.
