This is to install and configure the computers in our lab as LDAP
clients, that use the local LDAP server for logging in.

READ root_install?.bash before you just run them.
Run them in the order (0 1 2)
root_install_0.bash root_install_1.bash root_install_2.bash

It can't be just one script because you may need to reboot or run tests at
some points in the process.  The root_install_?.bash scripts are
interactive.

This is not complete and is not tested on a CentOS system.
Some refining may be needed.
We just got one system to work, but not by running theses scripts.
