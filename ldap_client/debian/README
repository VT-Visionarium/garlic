this is for use on debain not Xubuntu or CentOS.

This is to install and configure the computers in our lab as LDAP
clients, that use the VT LDAP server for logging in.

READ root_install?.bash before you just run them.

Run them in the order (1 2)
root_install_1.bash root_install_2.bash

It can't be just one script because you may need to reboot or run tests at
some points in the process.  The root_install_?.bash scripts are
interactive.
