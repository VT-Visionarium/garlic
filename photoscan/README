This little project was for running the proprietary software called
photoscan on the computer named cube.  Odd thing about cube is that it has
no regular monitor connected to it most of the time. Instead of monitors
it has video projectors plugged into it via display port cables.

This project is for a photoscan wrapper script named photoscan that runs
photoscan will what is needed to have it use the display port QBenz
monitor with the display port projector cable plugged into it from the
LBL (left bottom left eye) projector, using X11 DISPLAY :0.10 .

Dependencies:

  Install small_utils from https:/github.com/lanceman2/small_utils.git

  in particular we need "MovePointer" to be in your PATH.



TO INSTALL:


1. You need get PhotoScan at and unzip/untar it to some directory.

2. Edit the photoscan file in this directory so it refers to where
   you unpacked the photoscan directory with files like:

   photoscan.sh libQt5DBus.so.5 libQt5Gui.so.5 and so on...

3. Copy photoscan to from this directory to some directory like
   /usr/local/bin/ or /usr/local/bin/photoscan-5.0.0/ or whatever.
