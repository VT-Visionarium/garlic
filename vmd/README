   VMD (Visual Molecular Dynamics)

Downloading VMD is a pain in the ass, the download is
interactive and requires a web browser from a page near
URL:  http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/

Given it's not free (as in speech) I don't expect that
we can install it with apt-get (or yum).




DEPENDENCIES:
  
  apt-get install libnetcdf-dev netcdf-bin netcdf-doc tcl-dev tk-dev tcl-doc tk-doc flex-old csh rlwrap


FILES:

    vmd-1.9.2/

       Contains install.bash for good installation of vmd



    vmd-1.9.2-SHARED/

       was used to debug the VMD build process.  We found a
       BUG and proved it with this.
