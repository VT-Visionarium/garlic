# DIVERSE dtk depends on FLTK.  We had to purge all the FLTK packages
# from the system and install fltk from source to /usr/local/blablabla
# so that dtk could build.  It's just stuff that we do not want to waste
# time fixing.

# got the diverse code like so:

git clone https://github.com/lanceman2/diverse.git git

# At the time of this writing (9 Jan 2016), we did not get dtk to link
# with any of the apt based libfltk packages, libfltk1.1-dev or
# libfltk1.3-dev.  We got is to link with the fltk source in ../fltk.  See
# ../fltk for details.
