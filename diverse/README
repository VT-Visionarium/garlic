DIVERSE dtk depends on FLTK.  We had to purge all the FLTK packages
from the system and install fltk from source to /usr/local/blablabla
so that dtk could build.  It's just stuff that we do not want to waste
time fixing.


got the diverse code like so:
git clone https://github.com/lanceman2/diverse.git git

but the dtk-4.3/install.bash will get it automatically.

At the time of this writing (9 Jan 2016), we did not get dtk to link
with any of the apt based libfltk packages, libfltk1.1-dev or
libfltk1.3-dev.  We got is to link with the fltk source in ../fltk.  See
../fltk for details.


  dtk-4.5/ builds and installs a reduced number of things because
           we had problems with the newer xubuntu 10.04 system than
           compared to dtk-4.4/ which is not so reduced.  We are not
           sure if it is changes in fltk-1.3.1, CMake, and/or the
           newer GCC compiler suite.  Any who we are not going to
           fix this dieing code, just strip it and make it works.
