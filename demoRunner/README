demorunner - a simple http/HTML browser/server based demo runner

We run a localhost http server which get commands from a browser to
run programs on the localhost.  The browser user runs the simple
single process and single threaded http PHP server by running:

     php -S localhost:PORT


We build and install a stripped down PHP to be this server from
github.com repo.



# besides the GNU autotools we need re2c to build PHP:
apt-get install re2c

git clone https://github.com/php/php-src.git git


TO INSTALL:

1. Install PHP run:

     ./php-VERSION/install.bash

where VERSION is something like 7.0.6 or higher.

2. Setup the document root

    A work in progress.....
