The final form of this demoRunner is unclear, it may be merged into
hyperCube, or it may have more general scope than just running demos
in the Virginia Tech CAVE.

This is a web server directory tree.  We make a minimal approach just
segregating files by how they can be seen from the client end keeping
redundancy small.  We don't have concern segregating files based on
file type, so we can have CSS, php, and HTML files in the same directory.
The service is seem by the client as a tree of demos, with some cross
linking across branches.

This little HTTP service may or may not end up on the Internet so if you
develop it keep that in mind, by making web security a thing that is a
least future possibility.
