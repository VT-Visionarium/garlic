demorunner - a web based program runner
=======================================

Why
---

We needed a way to display and run programs.  Just look at images and
descriptions and click to run them.

How
---

The images and descriptions are generated with HTML in a browser, so it's
easy to customize what's displayed.  All the hard work is done by a web
browser (client) and server, and so this project ends up smaller.

You click on a particular program's description and the server runs the
program for you, and at your option, clicking again on the now running
program's description will kill the program and bring the program's
description back to a launcher state.

We made an effort not to over-engineer it, so we don't try to search and
kill all spawned processes (at least not by default).  If a program can't
clean up after itself, we leave it, killing only the top process, if it
still exists.  Besides some programs may correctly need to be demon like,
or be able to run multiple times.  So by default this launcher
(demorunner) only manages the first process that is spawned, and you build
from that.


Ports
-----

Current development is on Ubuntu (xubuntu 10.04) which is a GNU/Linux
distribution.


Building/Installing
-------------------





Example/Tutorial
----------------

You can run it in this source directory without installing it:

    make &&\
    gnome-terminal -e ./demoRunner-server &\
    sleep 2;\
    firefox http://localhost:8080/

Now click away.





Files:
------

    - GNUmakefile

       A GNU makefile that installs the demoRunner HTTP server script
       and other stuff, so that you have it in your PATH.



    - demorunner-server

       Runs the HTTP server for this demoRunner service.



    - testDocRoot/

       A test demo directory tree, used for demo-ing this package and
       developing it.





Prerequisite software:
--------------

    - nodejs

      From https://nodejs.org/.  We are currently using a build from
      github source via git source repo with git tag v6.2.2
      So for example run:
          
          git clone --branch v6.2.2 https://github.com/nodejs/node.git

      to get nodejs source with tag v6.2.2.
