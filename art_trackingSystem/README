Distributor ID:	Debian
Description:	Debian GNU/Linux 9.2 (stretch)
Release:	9.2
Codename:	stretch


You need to get the DTrack2 sofware from ART 
(Advanced Realtime Tracking) a German Company:
http://www.ar-tracking.com/support/
I had to wait a day to get the confirmation email
that gave me access to their web servers to get
the software. They don't use HTTP over TLS (https).

Got 2 tarballs:
  DTrack2CLI_v1.0.0_linux64.tar.gz
  DTrack2_v2.13.0_linux64.tar.gz


We installed it by running  ./install_DTrack2.bash
which installs the DTrack2_v2.13.0

we found that an old version of libpng12.so.0 was needed
This debain 9 system had a new version 
we copied a libpng12.so.0.54.0 from a xubuntu 16.04 system
from file /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpng12.so.0.54.0
we found that by running 'locate libpng12'


Calibration run 'DTrack2' which was in my path, notice that
it creates the .ART/ directory in your home directory.


Set the L-calibration stick in the center of the CAVE on the
floor with the +X coordinate toward the right projection wall
and the +Y coordinate at the center projection wall.

After setting up channel that writes to "this machine" port 5000
in the GUI DTrack2 program we can test by running:

DTrack2CLI 192.168.0.1 -meastart

# Test listener netcat program
nc -ulp 5000




We can setup this machine as a proxy server using netcat like so:

1. First on the receiving machine (to_address) run netcat or other
listening UDP/IP server like so:

nc -ulp 5000

2. Then run on the machine that has network access to the
ART tracker UDP/IP data:

nc -ulp 5000 | nc -u to_address 5000



Running InstantReality on Debian was a bust...
