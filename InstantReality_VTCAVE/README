Files in this directory are made into something installed or
are installed as they are.

In the VT CAVE we have no monitor on the main graphics render
computer so remember to 'ssh' to it with the '-X' option.

Rules that the GNUmakefile makes are:

  *.cpp files are made into *.iio files installed as InstantIO plug-ins
  *-nav.xd3 and *-nav.wrl are installed as InstantPlayer navigations
  *-engine.x3d and *-engine.wrl are installed as  InstantPlayer engines
  other *.x3d and *.wrl are installed as models.
  bash script are

These models are used to add pop-ups as debugging tools.


see GNUmakefile for default installation directories.

In short:

  *.cpp -> *.iio            ->   plug-ins

  *-nav.x3d *-nav.wrl       ->   navs

  *-engine.x3d *-engine.wrl ->   engines

  *.x3d *.wrl               ->   models

  executable scripts        ->   bin

exceptions test files are not installed

  none of the *_test bash script files are installed
  none of the *_test-engine.* files are installed
  none of the *_test-nav.* files are installed
  none of the *_test.* files are installed


just add files following these wildcard (glob) rules and you will not have
to change GNUmakefile.  If you have a C++ plug-in that has more then one
source file you'll need to edit GNUmakefile.  The CMakeLists.txt file was
just a test to see how bad CMake sucks.  It's just very bad at wildcards
and filename string patterns, and like things.  It can't do regrex replace
with groups of filenames in a reasonable way.  GNU make kicks it's ass.

To build and test stuff:

   make

and then run one of *.bash or an InstantPlayer command.


To install run:

   make -j4 && make install

To remove generated files:

   make clean
