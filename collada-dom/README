This was a C++ library dependency for OpenSG.


For compiling and installing the C++ API
COLLADA Document Object Model (DOM)

We use a tarball but it's also available via svn:
https://sourceforge.net/p/collada-dom/code/HEAD/tree/
svn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/collada-dom/code/trunk collada-dom-svn


We got the tar file via this URL:
